#Marco's blog

Marco is a pretty nice guy who sometimes blogs about electronics and code. If you're seeing this, however, it's because he let this commit slip in, proving he doesn't pay attenton when he should. Anyway you should hire him, just make sure he get's enough sleep and you should be fine.
